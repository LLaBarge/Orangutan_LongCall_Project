# Orangutan_LongCall_Project
This project focuses on the spatiotemporal dynamics of long distance vocalization behavior in flanged male Bornean orangutans

Explanation of raw data files:
LC_PAM: This is data from a passive acoustic monitoring system in Tuanan, Central Kalimatan, Indonesia (Borneo) to monitor the whereabouts of orangutans. These data include long calls from known and unknown individuals, x and y coordinates (UTM zone 50-South), who the initial caller was, and the identity of a responder - including the timelag to respond.

Script includes analysis of where and when individual animals spontaneously long call and where and when individual animals respond to hearing a competitors long call with their own call
